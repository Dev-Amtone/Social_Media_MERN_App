# MERN-Skeleton-User-auth-CRUD

Overview of the skeleton application
The skeleton application will encapsulate rudimentary features and a workflow that's repeated for most MERN applications. We will build the skeleton as a basic but fully functioning MERN web application with user create, read, update, delete (CRUD), and authentication-authorization (auth) capabilities; this will also demonstrate how to develop, organize, and run code for general web applications built using this
stack. The aim is to keep the skeleton as simple as possible so that it is easy to extend and can be used as a base application for developing different MERN applications.

•Backend Development:

-Backend code setup

-User model with Mongoose

-User CRUD API endpoints with Express 

-User Auth with JSON Web Tokens 

-Running backend code and checking APIs

•Frontend Development:

-Frontend features of the skeleton

-Setting up development with React, React Router, and Material-UI

-Rendering a home page built with React

-Backend user API integration

-Auth integration for restricted access

-User list, profile, edit, delete, sign up, and sign in UI to complete the user frontend

-Basic server-side rendering
